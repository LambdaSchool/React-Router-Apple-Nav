1. One of the main differences is that when a request is made during server-sided routing, the information sent requires a whole page to refresh.  However during client sided routing, this information is processed internally by java script engine, and changes to the request are prevented from being sent to the server and so this does not require the whole page to refresh.  Just based off of these two differences one can surmise that the  client sided routing is much faster than server sided. It is my understanding that usually, during server-sided routing, the component responsible for defining routes are links. When a link is clicked, the client sends a request which causes a change in the state of the page. In order to maintain what is displayed, for specific routes, it is essential to define the request and response logic.
