What is the difference between server side routing and client side routing?
Server side routing deals with the server re-rendering an entirely new page and client side routing is when just the parts that need updating are updated.

Mention some advantages of using client side routing.
Client side routing is faster since it only updates the part of the page and doesn't have to send a request to the server.

Which component is used to define a route and what props are commonly added to it?
A Route component is needed and a path that defines the route for that specific page.

How can I make sure that the component associated with the "/" route is not displayed for every other route?
You have to put an "exact" inside the Route Tag.
