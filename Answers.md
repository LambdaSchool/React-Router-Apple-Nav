# What is the difference between server-side routing and client-side routing?
  Just like the name(s) imply, server-side routing takes place in the server while
  client-side routing takes place in the client, or on the user end of the interaction.
  A single-page application with client routing is a great example of this. Older style websites 
  have the routing done on the server.
