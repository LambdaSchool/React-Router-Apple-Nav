1-2* On a web application that uses server side routing when user clicks on an anchor element the browser makes an HTTP GET request to the URL and server sends a new document as a response. The browser discards the old webpage altogether, and displays the newly downloaded one. If the web application uses client side routing then after user clicks on an anchor element, a client side code (the routing library) detects that the URL is not an external link and prevents the browser from making the GET request. The routing library then manually changes the URL displayed in the browser (using the HTML5 history API). After that it changes the state of the client app. It renders the new components, and if necessary, it requests new data from the server. But this time the response isn't necessarily an entire webpage. Client side routing is used by single page applications, where the actual site is never left. So the biggest advantage of the client side routing will be speed because app will be less dependant on the server. 

3-4* The <Route> component is the main building block of React Router. Anywhere that you want to only render something if it matches the locationâ€™s pathname, you should create a <Route> element. A React Router component that does not have a router as one of its ancestors will fail to work, so you will need to wrap your app with router component first. There are few props that are commonly added to the <Route /> component: "path" (url representation), "component" (which component to render on the provided path) and "exact" (is used to make sure that the component associated with the "/" route is not displayed for every other route).
