* 1 - What is the difference between server side routing and client side routing?
---
client side routing is routing that happens on the client (Browser, mobile device, etc), while server routing is handled
by the server. 
* 2 - Mention some advantages of using client side routing.
---
You do not need to make a request to the server and wait for a response.
* 3 - Which component is used to define a route and what props are commonly added to it?
---
In React Router you use the `Route` component and you path it a `path` and `component` prop.

* 4 - How can I make sure that the component associated with the "/" route is not displayed for every other route?
---
You use the `exact` prop.
