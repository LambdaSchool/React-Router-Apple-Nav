1. Server side routing is when a new page request is sent to the server by clicking on a link. Moreover, it causes the whole page to refresh in due that a new GET request is sent to the server which is responded with a new document. Where as, client side routing is when the route is handled internally by JavaScript i.e. when ever the user clicks over a link the url changes but request to the server is prevented.
2. The advantages of using client routing is that routing between views is faster and it allows to implement an easier and smooth transitions and animations between views.
3. Routing component is usded to define a route. histoty, location, params, are the most commonly added props.
4. By using exact param we can make sure that the component associated with the "/" is not displayed for every other route.
