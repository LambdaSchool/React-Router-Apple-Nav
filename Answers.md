# What is the difference between server-side routing and client-side routing?
  Just like the name(s) imply, server-side routing takes place in the server while
  client-side routing takes place in the client, or on the user end of the interaction.
  A single-page application with client routing is a great example of this. Older style websites 
  have the routing done on the server. In summary, client-side routing is essentially the same
  as server-side routing, except that it is done in the browser.

# Mention some advantages of using client-side routing
  A single-page web app using client-side routing allows the user to for the most part nagivate through the 
  entire website without having to wait for a response from the server, which eliminates the need to refresh
  the page. I look forward to eventually mastering this concept and the ability to implement it--I'd love to use
  React in new creative ways, such as making little web applets that can run entirely in the browser without
  the need for a server or Internet at all--such as a game or a choose-your-own adventure story.
